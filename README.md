# Coders-in-Action
This is a website about our school.



Our student page is more specific, it provides us information to our school.  Our client is the school.  We think we added good information to our website.  It was hard at first but when we got into it, we started getting better at it.  -Carter Guthrie


This project was extremely difficult and rigorous.  I am though, very grateful for the opportunity to even get a chance to go to San Francisco.  I feel as though if we had more time and more resources it would have turned out better.  -Kasia Cooksey


One of our pages, the student page, seems unfinished.  The reason is we have not had any students of the month, or MVP's in sports.  Making the website responsive on mobile and smaller resolution screens proved to be a complex task.  The time span we have over this project/website should be expanded just for a few more days because some people will still have problems close to the due date.  -Ernesto Lozano
